The pandemic changed how viewers consume media in 2021 and acted as a catalyst for the rising use of OTTs, causing a change in watching patterns. In a market that is changing and supported by more inexpensive data pricing, higher internet access, and smartphone use, both international firms and Indian streaming services are experiencing tremendous rise in viewership. But this is only the start. Consumption patterns may change as the pandemic's shadow fades, but the new normal is still far greater than pre-pandemic levels. Consumers are adopting different material on a range of topics as a result of the global economy's recovery, greater affluence, and increased exposure to international content. The OTT market has both opportunities and problems in the upcoming year.
